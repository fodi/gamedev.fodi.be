It was super fun and quite challenging by itself, but I decided to kill multiple birds with one stone: I recorded the whole process (the screen and my actual fat face) and even narrated it (albeit in Hungarian). I'm still editing the footage, but hopefully it will be up in a few days.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, if you'd like to take a look at what I managed to put together in 3 hours, check out <a href=\"https://fodi.itch.io/mediocre-container-package\">Mediocre Container Package</a>, the prototype of a wonky <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/212800/Super_Crate_Box/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Super Crate Box</a> clone. After the jam's voting period ended, I've pushed a minor update that fixes two issues and adds basic controller support too. The project file is also available on the Itch page if anyone is interested.</p>",

For arcade games they should basically be mandatory.</li>\n<li>We are still quite bad at time management. The day before the deadline we've made major changes to the mechanics and added a bunch of (although planned) features. The last day was about bugfixes and a very limited playtesting which meant that the game was quite unbalanced (but thankfully it's on the easier side).</li>\n<li>We need to do more jams this year. It's great fun, rewarding and a great learning experience still.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Without further ado: <a href=\"https://lasermagnet.itch.io/juice-jam-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">check out PowerCharger 4269 on Itch</a>! We have plans for updates that might or might not happen.</p>",

Tomorrow tops.</p>\n<p>The latest build can be found on <a href=\"https://fodi.itch.io/windy-physics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Itch</a>.</p>\n<h2>Devlog</h2>\n<p><strong>Update 1</strong>: the first public build is up on Itch; it has basic editor features (tools for moving, rotating, deleting wind generators), walls, ball spawners and balls. More tools and actual level targets are coming soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I've added an exit where balls should be directed and an objective (number of balls required to complete the level). There's also a timer and some visual flair (yeah, I like particle emitters). I should probably add an \"inventory\" next and figure out how to store and load level data (then probably make a basic level editor).</p>",
