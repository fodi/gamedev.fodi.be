            "content_html": "<p>The short story of a 5-hour Trijam game (khmm, overtime) that turned into something bigger.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe making games similar to Vampire Survivors is cliché nowadays, but I'm not known to give any dangs about such things. So when I saw the theme for <a href=\"https://itch.io/jam/trijam-270\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trijam #270</a> (\"in the zone\"), I felt that it was time I've made one.</p>\n<p>Even though I <em>kinda</em> managed to reach the playable state at the 3 hour mark, I opted to go overtime, since I had a bunch of important items on my todo list. This time I streamed the entire development (apart from the \"planning\" phase which consisted of making a half-assed todo list and gathering some 3rd party assets), the VOD is up on YouTube if anyone's interested in this sort of thing:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EULOvlYy-aQ\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EULOvlYy-aQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></a></p>\n<p>What I miserably failed at is naming the game properly (typical Fodi crap, when I get stuck with naming I get <em>really</em> stuck), so the entry was anti-titled <a href=\"https://fodi.itch.io/trijam-270\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Something Something Zones Something</a>, very much reusing the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oGMbAIcXCQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Family Guy reference</a> that I already used in a similar situation (for the Ludum Dare jam game <a href=\"https://lasermagnet.itch.io/ludum-dare-53-jam-version\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Something Something Delivery Something</a>). Oh well :)</p>\n<p>After finding the game (both the development and the gameplay) way too much fun, we opted to build upon it and submit the result for the Hungarian <a href=\"https://itch.io/jam/hej-2024-majus/entries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HEJ (Havi Egy Játék / One Game a Month) jam</a>. That's how Shortfall came to be. I even updated it for like two weeks after the jam based on the enormously useful feedback we received (thanks to everyone who participated!), which is not my usual modus operandi.</p>\n<p>I streamed some of the development on the 2nd of July:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCEKdqwr_Kc\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aCEKdqwr_Kc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></a></p>\n<p>And a bit on the 7th as well:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9FcpLyk62s\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o9FcpLyk62s\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></a></p>\n<p>I'd also like to say thanks to the amazing <strong>GrafxKid</strong> for the amazing free assets I used (Tibor was <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1e4wgol/combine_overwatch_soldier_cosplay_self/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">very much occupied with other things this month</a>). Be sure to check 'em out on <a href=\"https://grafxkid.itch.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Itch</a>!</p>\n<p>As you may or may not know, my goal for 2024 is to make at least 12 video game prototypes and next year choose one and turn it into an actual full-fledged Steam release. Shortfall is very much on the shortlist (pun intended) for this, along with <a href=\"https://lasermagnet.itch.io/attractaball\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Attractaball</a> and <a href=\"https://lasermagnet.itch.io/hedges-of-hell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hedges of Hell</a> which is the topic of my next blog post if I'm not too lazy to write it :)</p>\n<p>You can try the latest build of <a href=\"https://lasermagnet.itch.io/shortfall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shortfall on Itch</a> (per usual). It runs okay on mobile and supports gamepad controls too, but I highly recommend using the keyboard + mouse control scheme. One warning though: if you have motion sickness, you might find the turning mechanic a bit uneasy; the game is playable without it, but then again you might as well play Vampire Survivors :D</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Our third HEJ jam game was a tiling puzzle game based on famous paintings (that explode!).</p>\n\n<p>A few days before starting the project I did some ground work and tested a few open source JavaScript libraries that I needed to integrate: one for pixel-by-pixel comparison of images (so the game can detect when the player has successfully restored the original painting and can also show a percentage of how close they are at any moment), and one for rectangular bin packing (so the shapes making up the painting could \"explode\" and move to random positions inside a designated container without overlapping). The \"winning\" libraries were <a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pixelmatch</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/soimy/maxrects-packer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Max Rects Packer</a> respectively, they were both super simple to work with (kudos!). I even made a basic Construct 3 template utilizing Pixelmatch - if anyone is interested, <a href=\"https://github.com/fodi/construct-3-projects/tree/main/projectfolders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">it's available on my GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Still cutting it relatively close to the deadline, I started prototyping reCoupage at around 4 PM on the 1st of May, 6 days before the deadline. It was a super fun and productive first session and at 1AM (yep, flow happened) the proof of concept version was done: it had one puzzle based on a constructivist painting by Sándor Bortynik. It looked like this (in the \"exploded\" state):</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://gamedev.fodi.be/media/posts/53/recoupage-day1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://gamedev.fodi.be/media/posts/53/responsive/recoupage-day1-xs.png 300w ,https://gamedev.fodi.be/media/posts/53/responsive/recoupage-day1-sm.png 480w ,https://gamedev.fodi.be/media/posts/53/responsive/recoupage-day1-md.png 768w\"></figure>\n<p>The player's task is to move all pieces back to the canvas by dragging them with the mouse and rotating them with right click. To facilitate that, all shapes snap to a fixed grid and rotate in 30 degree angles. For reference, there's a snapshot of the original painting in the bottom right corner.</p>\n<p>I continued development on the 5th of May live on stream, after a lengthy overview I proceeded with feature development, while Tibor was working on new levels:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhDGRpxMzj4\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IhDGRpxMzj4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></a></p>\n<p>On the next day I managed to squeeze in another 4 hours of development, and on the day of the jam's deadline another 3 hours on stream</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GetlJAMvZk\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5GetlJAMvZk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></a></p>\n<p>...and another 4 hours off-stream (mostly taking care of the UI, audio &amp; playtesting). The final result can be played on <a href=\"https://lasermagnet.itch.io/recoupage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Itch</a> - so far there were a couple of minor post-jam updates based on feedback we received:</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"552\" height=\"167\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://itch.io/embed/2691508?linkback=true\"><a href=\"https://lasermagnet.itch.io/recoupage\">Recoupage by Lasermagnet Games, Fodi, Teebor9</a></iframe></div>\n<p>If you'd prefer just watching how the game works instead of playing it, here's a video of <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731590/Block_Shop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fellow game developer</a> and super nice human person <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/foolbox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foolbox</a> giving it a go:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKgWZk51IBY\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKgWZk51IBY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Hello, and welcome back to the latest episode of How (not) to TriJam with your host: me.</p>\n\n<p>I spent the last weekend of April in decision fatigue land. I wanted make a short jam game, so I did the usual thing on Saturday: I went through the currently running <a href=\"https://itch.io/jams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jams on Itch.io</a> looking for ones with interesting themes / restrictions and started ideation. By afternoon I was sure that I wasn't going to start actual development, so I figured maybe collecting some assets will help me get started on Sunday.</p>\n<p>It didn't. I couldn't decide on what to make and ended up watching <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/2nerdynerds\">2NerdyNerds on Twitch</a> instead (which is my absolute favourite gamedev stream by the way, check them out!). A fun time, but I really wasn't happy about \"skipping gamedev practice\".</p>\n<p>On Monday I woke up around 6 AM and immediately decided I'm going to fix things. I quickly went through my morning routine, made a todo list and cycled to the office with the intention of making a \"last minute\" entry for TriJam, since the deadline is always on Monday at 11 AM. A little after 8 AM I started streaming and did this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTdutcB35js\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mTdutcB35js\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></a></p>\n<p>The main lesson learned: don't try to innovate if you only have 3 hours to make a game from scratch 😄. Mixing tile-based movement with physics (with no previous relevant experience) was way too ambitious, so by the time I got most features working I only had a few minutes to do level design, which is suboptimal to say the least.</p>\n<p>Still, I can call it a prototype I guess, so ka-ching, I'm incrementing the game counter for <a href=\"https://gamedev.fodi.be/2023-recap-and-a-new-challenge/\">my 2024 challenge</a> with <a href=\"https://fodi.itch.io/trijam-267\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Untitled Digging Game</a>. It's buggy, it's super short, but I learned new things while making it and hopefully I'm getting better at streaming in English too.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend <a href=\"https://trijam.itch.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TriJam</a> to any fellow game developers, it's a hoot, it's on every weekend and the 3-hour limit is more of a recommendation anyway - unless you are literally starting 3 hours before the deadline like I did this time 😁.</p>",

Sort of.</p>\n<p>In this action platformer (with minor puzzle elements) you (singular... OR plural!) control a whirl (wheel?) of magnetic (magic?) energy, that collides with most things, but not with the small googly eyed balls that spawn on every level. Your task is to guide the little ones to exit portals; sometimes just one, sometimes a whole school of them.</p>\n<p>One of the themes for the jam was \"Rube Goldberg machine\", which we contemplated using at first, but then we abandoned the idea of making something along the lines of The Incredible Machine and shifted towards the second theme, \"weight/crowd\". As in a crowd of bouncy balls with different weights (blue ones are heavier and more stiff, pink ones are lighter and a lot more bouncy).</p>\n<p>The jam version has no touch input support, so you're going to need a trusty mouse and/or a gamepad(s; did I mention it has co-operative multiplayer for up to 3 people?) to control this one, although it's possible that post-jam updates might add touch controls. But at first we want to add some more levels and a few more mechanics; so stay tuned.</p>\n<p>You can find Attractaball on Itch. Don't forget to switch to full screen mode (by pressing F) if you are using mouse input! I kinda forgot to mention that in-game... :)</p>",

Sheets are named after the relevant object type or family. If I want to run actions when a certain object is created, I put this in a custom cation called <strong>init</strong>; if an object needs to be constantly \"updated\", I create a custom action called <strong>tick</strong> and handle things there. This is similar to how you'd do things in Godot with the _ready and _process functions.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Events </strong>folder contains sheets prefixed with the letter \"e\". Each sheet only has events with primary conditions of a certain \"category\". Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>eCreated:</strong> \"on X created\" events</li>\n<li><strong>eCollisions:</strong> \"on collision with\" and \"is overlapping\" events</li>\n<li><strong>eCycles:</strong> \"on start of layout\", \"every tick\" and \"every X seconds\" events</li>\n<li><strong>eInput:</strong> keyboard / gamepad / mouse / touch events</li>\n<li><strong>eMovement:</strong> events with conditions of movement behaviours</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>Functions </strong>folder has sheets prefixed with the letter \"f\". These sheets only contain functions of a certain \"category\". Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>fLevel:</strong> level initialization, win / lose condition handling, etc</li>\n<li><strong>fUI:</strong> functions that update parts the user interface</li>\n<li><strong>fUtilities:</strong> full screen toggle function, math functions that return values, et cetera</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>Values</strong> folder has exactly 3 sheets that only contain global variables or constants in them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>vState:</strong> for global game state related variables</li>\n<li><strong>vConstants:</strong> global constants (I prefix those with \"C_\"), mostly numbers</li>\n<li><strong>vMacros:</strong> also global constants that serve as \"macros\" - more on that later :)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Event sheets that are not in a subfolder are assigned to layouts. Usually I have one called<span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"> </span><strong style=\"font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\">Main</strong><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"> (or </span><strong style=\"font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\">Level</strong><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">) that includes all sheets in the </span><strong><span style=\"font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\">Events</span></strong><span style=\"font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\"> folder and nothing else;</span><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"> there's no need to include sheets from the other folders, custom actions, functions and global variables / constants are always available. This sheet is set as the \"Event sheet\" on all level layouts. For menu screens I usually use a separate layout with its own event sheet.</span></p>\n<p>I suffix all sheet names with emojis (pro tip for Windows devs: press Win + comma to open the emoji panel), so I can find them more easily when I have a metric crapton of tabs open.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>Tangential sidenote</strong><br>Using emojis in names of C3 primitives and project folders instead of single file (.c3p) projects means that you'll have file names on your filesystem that contain emojis. NTFS on Windows 10 seems to handle that without problems, but your mileage might vary on Linux or Mac filesystems. You might also have issues if you store project folders in Dropbox, as it will refuse to sync those files. Because of that, I went back to saving my projects in .c3p files and storing those in Dropbox. Dropbox saved my bacon a few times when I've accidentally saved or overwritten a project, as it keeps previous versions of files (as long as it's able to sync them to their server) which you can restore.</p>\n<p>If you want to give my organization system a go, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/fodi/construct-3-projects/tree/main/projectfolders/BlankTemplate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">download my template</a> that I almost always use for new projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1htk1ijds15\">Using \"macros\"</h2>\n<p>I try not to use literals in conditions / actions when referencing animation names, layers, effects, tags and such: instead, I use \"macros\", which are global constants defined in the <strong>vMacros</strong> sheet. Example: if I have a sprite that has an \"Idle\" and \"Walking\" animation, I create constants named \"ANIM_Idle\" and \"ANIM_Walking\" in the \"vMacros\" sheet with the values \"Idle\" and \"Walking\" respectively, and use those in conditions and actions instead of the string literals \"Idle\" and \"Walking\".</p>\n<p>This has a couple of benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You get autocompletion that is typo-proof: just start typing the name of the constant wherever you want to use it's value in a condition or action.</li>\n<li>You can use \"Find all references\" on the \"macro\" to find its occurrences.</li>\n<li>If you decide you want to <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rename</a> eg. an animation from \"Walking\" to \"Running\", you only have to make the change in two places: the animation editor and the \"macro\". This is less error prone compared to search &amp; replace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also use some special macros which have no prefixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NOTHING, with the numeric value of -1: whenever I have variables that store UIDs and want to clear them, I set their values to NOTHING. If I want to check if they have been assigned, I compare them to NOTHING.</li>\n<li>YES and NO with the respective numeric values of 1 and 0. This stems from the fact that you can't pass a variable or calculated value to a function or custom action with a boolean parameter: when calling it, you have to use a checkbox to either pass true or false, you cannot write an expression or reference a variable. Because of this I refrain from using boolean parameters in functions and custom actions, instead I use numbers just in case I ever need to do the aforementioned. And when I don't, I pass the YES or NO macro.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1htk1ijds16\">Picky blindspots (sorry)</h2>\n<p>A significant amount of bugs I create are related to screwing up picking conditions: either picking something I don't want to pick, picking the wrong instance or failing to pick something. Here are some suggestions and known footguns related to object instance picking.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you only want to pick a single object, make sure that the conditions only pick one. If unsure, add a \"pick nth instance\" condition with the parameter \"0\".</li>\n<li>If you're storing UIDs in (instance) variables, make their default value is a negative number (eg. -1) and not 0, since 0 could be a valid UID since it's zero indexed. When you clear the variable, also reset it to a negative number.</li>\n<li>Don't forget that the timer behaviour's \"On timer\" condition might pick multiple instances if those instances reach their time in the same tick and you might need to put in an extra \"For each\" to run actions on all of them. <a href=\"https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/behavior-reference/timer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This is mentioned in a big yellow warning box in the docs by the way.</a></li>\n<li>Functions and custom actions have a similarly named option: \"copy picked\" and \"copy all picked\". If you have a custom action for an object type or family \"X\" and call it from an event that already picked some instances of \"X\", those will be passed on to the custom action even if you don't check \"copy all picked\" (which is for passing other non-\"X\" instances to the custom action).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1htk33g5r4u\">Keyboard shortcuts</h2>\n<p>In event sheets you can do almost everything without touching the mouse. Although I still find myself using it at times, I gained considerable speed by learning <a href=\"https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/interface/keyboard-shortcuts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the handful of shortcuts</a> for creating events, conditions, actions, functions, comments, inline scripts, parameters and variables alone. One thing that is missing at the moment is a keyboard shortcut for creating custom actions, but I have a <a href=\"https://github.com/Scirra/Construct-feature-requests/issues/208\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">feature request for that</a> too (I'd sure appreciate some upvotes on it if you have a GitHub account, thanks ;).</p>\n<p>You can select events, conditions and actions using the arrow keys (which will also require some practice, but it's totally worth it), toggle breakpoints, bookmarks and disabled state. Navigating the condition / action editor is also fully possible using keyboard shortcuts, and of course you can use the system-wide shortcuts like (Shift+)Tab to jump between fields, Ctrl + left / right arrows to move the cursor in text fields one word at a time and Enter to apply changes. The automatically focused search bar in the condition / action editor is also a godsend, you can just start typing what you're looking for, it's basically a 2D autocomplete that you can also navigate using the arrow keys.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1htk33g5r4v\">Embrace the web platform</h2>\n<p>Construct 3 runs entirely in a browser and you can also <a href=\"https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/getting-started/get-construct-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">install it as a PWA</a> if you are using Chromium (my choice), Google Chrome, Edge or possibly other Chromium-derived browsers. This means you'll be able to start Construct like you start any other desktop app, use it in an almost full screen window (you can go full screen with F11 if you prefer) and have it associated with the .c3p file type.</p>\n<p>Another great thing is that you can integrate JavaScript libraries in your projects fairly easily, which opens up a lot of cool possibilities. Some examples of libraries I've glued in previously:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kchapelier/wavefunctioncollapse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WaveFunctionCollapse</a> by KChapelier for procedural level generation</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/damianofalcioni/js-aruco2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JS-ARUCO2</a> by DamianoFalcioni &amp; JCMellado for fiducial marker tracking via camera</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ondras/rot.js\">rot.js</a> by Ondras for procedural level generation (and more)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pixelmatch</a> by Mapbox for comparing the contents of Drawing Canvas objects</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/soimy/maxrects-packer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Max Rects Packer</a> by Soimy for bin packing objects</li>\n<li>The official <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTube IFrame Player API</a> for controlling YouTube embeds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And since your projects are JavaScript apps, you can also use the developer tools in your browser, including the console: the stock Browser plugin / object has actions that write to the console, but of course you can use console.log() and friends in code blocks or the code editor as well.</p>",

I like those kinds of \"deterministic puzzles\", but as I've anticipated, coming up with a proper level generation algorithm is not an easy task (for me at least).
